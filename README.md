Polynomial-Time Structural Beam Approach to TSP
This repository contains the implementation, experimental data, and supplementary material for our research on a deterministic structural beam algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
The algorithm:
Runs in polynomial time and space (empirically ~O(n³.4) in time, ~O(n¹.5) in memory).
Matches Held–Karp optimal solutions up to n=12.
Scales efficiently to n=100 in stress tests.
